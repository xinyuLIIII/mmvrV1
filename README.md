# EgoHand: Ego-centric Hand Pose Estimation and Gesture Recognition with Head-mounted Millimeter-wave Radar and IMUs
Recent advanced Virtual Reality (VR) headsets, such as the Apple Vision Pro, employ bottom-facing cameras to detect hand gestures and inputs, which offers users significant convenience in VR interactions. However, these bottomfacing cameras can sometimes be inconvenient and pose a risk of unintentionally exposing sensitive information, such as private body parts or personal surroundings. To mitigate these issues, we introduce EgoHand. This system provides an alternative solution by integrating millimeter-wave radar and IMUs for hand gesture recognition, thereby offering users an additional option for gesture interaction that enhances privacy protection. To accurately recognize hand gestures, we devise a two-stage skeleton-based gesture recognition scheme. In the first stage, a novel end-to-end Transformer architecture is employed to estimate the coordinates of hand joints. Subsequently, these estimated joint coordinates are utilized for gesture recognition. Extensive experiments involving 10 subjects show that EgoHand can detect hand gestures with 90.8% accuracy. Furthermore, EgoHand demonstrates robust performance across a variety of cross-domain tests, including different users, dominant hands, body postures, and scenes.


## Prerequisites

- Linux
- Python 3.7
- CPU or NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN

## Getting Started

### Installation

- Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WhisperYi/mmVR.git
cd mmVR
```

- Install [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org) and other dependencies (e.g., torchvision, torch, numpy).
  - Legacy Transformer environment (historical, Python 3.7):
    - Pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - Conda: `conda env create -f environment.yaml`
  - Recommended unified environment (Python 3.10, supports Transformer + Mamba):
    - Conda: `conda env create -f environment_py310.yaml`
    - Activate: `conda activate mmvr-py310`
    - This locks `torch==2.5.1`, `torchvision==0.20.1`, `torchaudio==2.5.1`, `timm==1.0.24`, and fixed official wheels for `causal-conv1d` / `mamba-ssm`.
  - Compatibility alias for older notes/scripts:
    - Conda: `conda env create -f environment_mamba.yaml`
  - Recommended script install (best match for the official Mamba wheels and detailed logs):
    - `bash scripts/setup_mmvr_py310.sh`
    - Optional custom env name: `bash scripts/setup_mmvr_py310.sh my-mmvr-env`
    - Defaults to CUDA `cu118`, which is the recommended target for future `RTX 2080 Ti` experiments.

### mmVR dataset

- Download [mmVR_dataset](https://kaggle.com/datasets/cdf079d9f49052500a08482b692eac6758d83e6b1ba9868d677c5cb814c427aa):
  - Download the `dataset.zip`, unzip it and move it to `./data/`

- Train and test model by mmwave + imu (stage1):

```bash
python train_kpt.py 
```

- Train and test model by mmwave + imu (Mamba variant):

```bash
python train_kpt_mamba.py
```

- Train and test model by keypoint (stage2):

```bash
python train_cls.py 
```
